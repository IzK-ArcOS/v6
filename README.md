ArcOS is the advanced Svelte-based Operating System Environment in your browser. With ArcOS we aim to create the best possible experience we can within the confines of your browser. ArcOS consists of:
- 📊 Advanced process and service management,
- ☁ Readymade cloud storage to access your account from anywhere using ArcOS' [ArcAPI](https://github.com/IzK-ArcOS/ArcOS-API-Rewritten) (WIP),
- 🔐 A secure user system consisting of hashed and salted passwords,
- 🗄 Filesystem integration to store, create and upload files,
- 📧 A built-in messaging system to talk to other ArcOS users on the same server,
- ✨ Endless customization options to really adjust ArcOS to your personal taste,
- 🐣 Beginner-friendly User Interface without the need of manuals,
- 🧾 Inclusive Help & Support center to read up on things you don't immediately understand,
- ⚠ Powerful error reporting and crash logs so that we can fix anything that's wrong as fast as possible

## 🛠 Getting started
The easiest way to use ArcOS is to open it on [the web frontend](https://web.izk-arcos.nl/), which is always updated to match the current version of ArcOS. If you prefer a download instead, you can find the latest updates on [the releases page](https://github.com/IzK-ArcOS/ArcOS-Frontend/releases). This Desktop App is powered by Electron, and it might perform better than the browser version, depending on the browser and device.

> It is not currently possible to clone the Source Code of ArcOS since ArcOS v6 isn't public as of March 25th, 2024.

## 💪 Contributing
Found something you miss or is there a bug that we need to resolve? The best place for bugs is **Bug Reports** inside ArcOS, and [the issues page](https://github.com/IzK-ArcOS/ArcOS-Frontend/issues) for feature requests and stuff that needs further discussion.

Code contribution to ArcOS isn't currently possible because ArcOS v6 isn't a public repository.

> [!WARNING]
> The code you see in [IzK-ArcOS/ArcOS-Frontend](https://github.com/IzK-ArcOS/ArcOS-Frontend) belongs to the now discontinued ArcOS v5. This code is not current anymore, pull requests regarding it will be ignored.

## Disclaimers
- ArcOS cannot be used as a primary operating system. An attempt to do so is discouraged.
- This is not an actual operating system. It is an environment that runs on top of your already existing OS, built using web technologies. It isn't possible to install already existing applications from third parties. This functionality may be implemented in the distant future.
- All assets in ArcOS, including those created by the team, belong to their respective owners. Reuse without credit is not permitted.
- The ArcOS team is not responsible for loss of data when using ArcAPI. Do not store sensitive info on the File System. ArcAPI passwords are hashed and salted.
