Welcome to the 6th iteration of ArcOS! This repository is a rewrite of the current ArcOS v5 codebase which can be found [here](https://github.com/IzK-ArcOS/ArcOS-Frontend). This project is still written in Svelte and Typescript, making it extremely performant and easy to maintain. More information about this project can be found [here](https://github.com/IzK-ArcOS?view_as=public).

> Note: The ArcOS Documentation is currently being worked on by the DWC internal team and might have missing and/or incomplete information. Please be patient.

## Getting Started

To use ArcOS, you can use the current Electron implementation found in the [releases tab](https://github.com/IzK-ArcOS/ArcOS-Frontend/releases/). You can also manually compile the desktop application with **ArcOS Electron Compiler**. All information about building the Electron application is contained on [ArcOS Electron Compiler GitHub repository](https://github.com/IzK-ArcOS/ArcOS-Electron-Compiler) (currently in beta).

You can also use the web frontend, found [here](https://web.izk-arcos.nl/).

If you want to compile the ArcOS frontend from the source, you may do so by following the steps of the [Getting Started](docs/Getting%20Started.md) page in the repository.
