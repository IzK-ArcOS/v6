## Opening the File Manager

Opening the File Manager can be done in a bunch of different ways:

1. ### Right-clicking the desktop

   You can open the File Manager by right-clicking the desktop, and selecting **File Manager** in the menu that appears

2. ### Start menu system folders

   You can also click on any link in right panel of the Start Menu to open the File Manager in the respective system folder.

3. ### Regular app shortcuts

   You can open the File Manager by clicking it in the left panel of the Start Menu or on the Desktop.

4. ### Launching it from ArcTerm (technical)

   You can also use the `spawn` command in [ArcTerm](@client/help/ArcTerm.md) to open the File Manager:

   ```
   ~/ $ spawn FileManager ["FOLDER_PATH","SELECTED_FILE_PATH"]
   ```

   where you can optionally specify what folder to open and the file to select. You can can omit these by leaving out the `["FOLDER_PATH","SELECTED_FILE_PATH"]` part of the command. Example:

   ```
   ~/ $ spawn FileManager ["./Pictures","./Pictures/Cute_Dog.png"]
   ```
