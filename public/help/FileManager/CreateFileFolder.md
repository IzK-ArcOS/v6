## Creating files and folders

Files and folders can be created from within the File Manager, or other applications in ArcOS. In this article we'll show you how you can create files and folders in the File Manager.

### Creating a file

First, open the File Manager and navigate to the folder in which you want to create the file. Once you're in the folder of choice, right click on an empty area and go to **Add** -> **Empty File**:

A new item will appear with a question mark. In the input box beside the icon, type in the name of the file you wish to create, and hit `Enter`:

After that the file will be created, and it's ready to use.

### Creating a folder

In the File Manager, navigate to the folder in which you want to create another folder, and click on the **Add Folder** button in the toolbar:

In the bar that drops down from the toolbar, enter the name of the folder you wish to create, and click on **Create**:

To abort creating the folder, click on **Cancel** to the right of the Folder Create Toolbar.

You can also create an empty folder by right clicking on an empty area, and by selecting **Add** -> **Folder**, after which the same Folder Create Toolbar will drop down at the top of the File Manager:
