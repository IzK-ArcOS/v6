## Opening Files

When you double-click on a file, ArcOS will try to find an application to open it in. If it can't find anything, it'll give you the option to select from a list of all _File Handlers_ available. Most of these handlers are made to process only a specific type of file, so there's no telling if the file you're trying to open will work with it.

To explicitly open a file with another application, Select and then right-click the file, and select an application from the **Open With** submenu:

Selecting any of those options will perform the action or open the app with the file.
