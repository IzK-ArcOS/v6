## What are system folders?

System folders are folders that ArcOS creates for you automatically. If any of these are missing, ArcOS will create them the next time a File Manager is opened. System folders are shown in the Right Pane of the Start Menu, and in the top of the File Manager Sidebar.

Most system folders are indicated with a special icon that fits the contents of the folder. You might find that the Pictures system folder has a folder with a picture in it as its icon.

Here is a list of the System Folders ArcOS creates:

| Icon                           | Name       | Path           | Usecase                                                       |
