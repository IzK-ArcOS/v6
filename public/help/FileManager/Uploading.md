## Uploading files to ArcOS

To upload files to ArcOS, open a File Manager, and navigate to whewre you want to upload the file. Then, click on the Upload button in the File Manager Toolbar to select files from your system you wish to upload. It's important to keep in mind here that...

- It's not possible to upload a folder
- File uploading is limited to a couple per second to avoid rate limiting
- ArcOS will overwrite any files that already exist in the folder to which you're uploading.

> ArcOS can in no way access your device's filesystem. Any files ArcOS can access are those given to it by you via the dialogs of the browser or Desktop App. Do not upload sensitive information like legal documents to ArcOS. Your server's administrator might look at your files, that's out of our control.

### Drag & Drop

It is also possible to upload a set of files to ArcOS by dragging and dropping the file onto the File Manager's directory listing. This has the same effect as clicking on the Upload button in the toolbar.

Once you drop files onto the File Manager, ArcOS will begin reading and uploading them to your account one by one.

# Downloading files from ArcOS

To download a file from your ArcOS account, first select the file in the File Manager, and then click on the **Download** icon in the Toolbar at the top of the window. Do note that it is not possible to download entire folders.
