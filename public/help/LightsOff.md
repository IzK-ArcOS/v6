The level-based game that is a treat for your memory. The objective is to turn off all the colored squares in the 5x5 grid of each level. There are 8 levels in total, progressively becoming harder as you go on.

When you click on a light, a "star-like" shape is projected onto the board. So not only the square you clicked toggles, but also the squares that are directly attached to it on the top, left, bottom and right.

You need to try to turn off the lights of each level with the least amount of clicks. If you've found the fastest method, here is how many clicks
are necessary for each level:

| Level  | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5   | 6   | 7   | 8   |
| ------ | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Clicks | 1   | 2   | 3   | 3   | 4   | 4   | 4   | 5   |

<br/>

When you've completed all levels, you'll get the option to play again. You can also choose that at any other time by clicking **Start Over** in the top left of the window.

Your game is saved automatically to your ArcOS user data. So, if you come back tomorrow, your Lights Off will be exactly as you left it.
