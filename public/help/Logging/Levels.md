## Logging levels

Each log item has a level associated with it to indicate the severity of a potential problem. This is what they mean:

- `info` - Informational logs that show exactly what is happening
- `warning` - Some problem occured, but ArcOS can proceed without taking any further action
- `error` - Soemthing went wrong, and you might experience some issues with what you were doing when the error occured
- `critical` - ArcOS is now unstable and will likely crash as fast as possible. This is a critical fault that requires a full restart.
