# Managing processes

When you open the Process Manager, you'll see a list of processes. Each process has a unique ID, called the Process Identifier (PID). When a process spawns, the handler (also known as the "stack") gives the process this unique ID.

On the left of each process, you can see the name and icon. If the process is an app, its name will be displayed. Otherwise, a more technical name is provided instead.

On the right of each process, you can see the PID and optionally the App's ID.

In the bottom left corner you can see the amount of processes that are currently active. To the right of it you can see a couple buttons:

- Pressing **App Info** opens the Application Information dialog of the currently selected application,
- Pressing **Focus** brings the selected application to the front.
- Pressing **Kill Process** (or **Kill App**, depending on the process) will stop the process entirely.
