# Qlorb

Welcome to Qlorb. It's a game based on precision, reflexes and pure skills. The objective of the
game is to get as many points as you can by interacting with the "orbs" that float on your screen.

- Click a **Green** or **Gold** orb with your left mouse button
- Click a **Red** orb with your right mouse button

There are 10 levels, starting at 0. The levels are decided based on how many points you have. Each
level has a different color. If you mis-click at any point, you'll lose upwards of a hundred
points. If your score is already below 100, it will be reset back down to 0.
