    The Settings App

</h1>

From here you can manage all your ArcOS settings, conveniently put in one place. The settings app consists of pages. Each page is a category of different settings you can change. Each setting updates immediately, so there's no need to hit save on anything. From visual settings to app management, it's all in here.

![icon](#InfoIcon) In this article, we'll go over the basics of the settings you can change.

## Opening the settings app

Opening it is quite easy. The easiest method is by simply pressing the `Alt`+`Shift`+`I` keyboard shortcut. Pressing these will either open or focus the Settings app. Alternatively, you can open Settings using one of these interactive options:

1. **Pressing the settings gear**
   <br/>
   The Settings gear is located in both the Start Menu and Action Center:

2. **Launching it from ArcTerm (Technical)**
   <br/>

   You can also use the `spawn` command in [ArcTerm](@client/help/ArcTerm.md) to open the Settings App:

   ```
   ~/ $ spawn SettingsApp ["PAGE_ID"]
   ```

   where you can optionally put a page ID to open in place of `PAGE_ID`. If you don't want to specify a page ID, you can simply remove the `["PAGE_ID"]` part from the command.

## What pages are there?

Here is a table of all the settings pages, along with their IDs for the `spawn` arguments.
