# Managing your account

Your account is essentially who you are on the specific server you're connected to. Each user has a name, password, profile picture, et cetera. From this Settings page you can change your account's settings. In this article you'll learn how to:

- Change your profile picture
- Change your username or password
- Delete your account

Before you continue, first open the **Settings App**. More information about opening the settings app can be found in the [Settings](@client/help/Settings.md) article under **"Opening the settings app"**. Once opened, make sure you're on the **Account** page by clicking your username in the top left.

## Changing your profile picture

To change your profile picture, click on the small Edit button to the bottom right corner of your profile picture:

Clicking this will display a selection of built-in profile pictures. If you pick one, your account will automatically update, and you can click **Done** to go back to the Account page.

To apply a custom profile picture, click **Custom**. A new dialog will open, allowing you to enter the internet address (or URL) of any image on the internet. Enter the URL and click on **Confirm** to apply the changes, or **Cancel** to discard them.

## Changing your username

To change your username, click the Edit button next to your username, as shown here:

In the dialog that appears, enter in a new username for your account, and click **Confirm** to apply the changes, or **Cancel** to discard them:

> Your saved login will change on this exact instance of ArcOS, but you will have to log back in manually on any other instance that is set to log in to your account. We have no way of updating those credentials automatically. Sorry!

## Changing your password

To change your password, click the Edit button next to your username, as shown here:

In the dialog that appears, enter in the old password and a new password twice for your account. Click **Confirm** to apply the changes, or **Cancel** to discard them:

## Deleting your account

Please do note that deleting your account is an irreversible destructive action. Once your account is deleted, there is no way to get it back. Only do this if you're 100% certain that you want to delete your account from the ArcOS Server you're connected to.

To delete your account, click the **Delete Account** button on the Account page:
![large](@client/help/assets/settings-account-delete-button.png)

ArcOS will provide you with a string of text you'll have to type before the deletion can be set into action. Type the string exactly, and click **Delete account** to confirm the deletion, or **Back to safety** to stop your account from being blown to smithereens:
