# Managing your account

Your account is essentially who you are on the specific server you're connected to. Each user has a name, password, profile picture, et cetera. From this Settings page you can change your account's settings.

## Table of contents

Select any one of these links to get information about that topic:

- [Change your profile picture](@client/help/Settings/account/changeprofile.md)
- [Change your username or password](@client/help/Settings/account/credentials.md)
- [Delete your account](@client/help/Settings/account/delete.md)

Before you continue, first open the **Settings App**. More information about opening the settings app can be found in the [Settings](@client/help/Settings.md) article under **"Opening the settings app"**. Once opened, make sure you're on the **Account** page by clicking your username in the top left.
