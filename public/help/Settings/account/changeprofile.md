Clicking this will display a selection of built-in profile pictures. If you pick one, your account will automatically update, and you can click **Done** to go back to the Account page.

To apply a custom profile picture, click **Custom**. A new dialog will open, allowing you to enter the internet address (or URL) of any image on the internet. Enter the URL and click on **Confirm** to apply the changes, or **Cancel** to discard them.
