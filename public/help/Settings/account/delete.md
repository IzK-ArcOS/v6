# Deleting your account

Please do note that deleting your account is an irreversible destructive action. Once your account is deleted, there is no way to get it back. Only do this if you're 100% certain that you want to delete your account from the ArcOS Server you're connected to.

To delete your account, click the **Delete Account** button on the Account page:

ArcOS will provide you with a string of text you'll have to type before the deletion can be set into action. Type the string exactly, and click **Delete account** to confirm the deletion, or **Back to safety** to stop your account from being blown to smithereens:
