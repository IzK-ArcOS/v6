# The Login Background

The login background is displayed when you log in to your account. If set, it replaces the default background of the Login screen if your account is selected. This does mean that the background you choose will be visible to everyone on the server you're connected to. In this article, you'll learn how to:

- Apply a login background
- Use an Internet Address (URL) as login background
- Reset the login background

Before you continue, first open the **Settings App**. More information about opening the settings app can be found in the [Settings](@client/help/Settings.md) article under **"Opening the settings app"**. Once opened, make sure you're on the **Login Background** page by clicking on **Login Background** in the sidebar.

## Applying a login background

To apply a login background, make sure you're on the **Login Background** page. Then, click on one of the images displayed below the preview:

To use a URL as login background, click on the **Login Background from URL** button on the Login Background page:

A confirmation dialog will appear, asking you to confirm if you want to reset the background. Click **Yes** to confirm the reset:
