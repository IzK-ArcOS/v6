# The Shell

The shell is probably the most important component of ArcOS. Without it, you wouldn't really be able to open applications or anything. The shell includes the **Start Menu**, **Taskbar** and **Action Center**.

Before you continue, first open the **Settings App**. More information about opening the settings app can be found in the [Settings](@client/help/Settings.md) article under **"Opening the settings app"**. Once opened, make sure you're on the **Shell** page by clicking on **Shell** in the sidebar.

Below you'll find an explanation for each of the Shell settings.

## Center Taskbar Buttons

Does what you would expect it to do. Enabling this setting will put the Opened Apps on your taskbar in the middle instead of on the left. However, the Start Button stays on the side.

## Taskbar Labels

Taskbar labels display the Window Title of the opened application. If you have a file opened in Writer, it'll show up in the taskbar as that name. Enabling this setting turns on the taskbar labels.

If the taskbar is in a vertical position, taskbar labels won't be visible.

## Taskbar Position

The taskbar be placed on any edge of your screen. To change where your taskbar is positioned, click on the desired position on the **Shell** page, next to the **Taskbar Position** text:

The taskbar will then automatically change where it is on the screen.

## Accented start button

Enabling this setting will change your start button to match your accent color:

| Disabled                                                       | Enabled                                                       |
