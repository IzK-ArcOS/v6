# Applying a theme

When you want to change the appearance of ArcOS according to a theme, you have to _apply_ it. This can be done in two ways. One is through the [Settings](@client/help/Settings.md) app, the other is using the [File Manager](@client/help/FileManager.md). Here they are:

1. ### Clicking on the theme in the Settings App

   If the theme is on the Themes page, simply click it to apply. This will immediately apply the settings from the theme:
   ![large](@client/help/assets/settings-themes-apply.png)

2. ### Opening the file through the File Manager
   If you have a Theme File on your filesystem (a file ending in `.arctheme`), you can apply it by double-clicking it in the File Manager as so:
   ![large](@client/help/assets/settings-themes-fstheme-apply.png)
