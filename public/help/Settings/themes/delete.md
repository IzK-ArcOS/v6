# Deleting a theme

Deleting a theme can only be done with themes you created. The built-in themes cannot be deleted. You can consider those themes to be "read-only".

To delete a user theme, simply right click it in the Settings app and select the **Delete theme** option:

A confirmation will appear, asking you if you really want to delete this theme. Keep in mind that deleting a theme cannot be reverted. Deleted themes are lost forever. To delete the theme, click on **Delete Theme**:

The theme will then be removed from your account.
