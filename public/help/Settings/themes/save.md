## Save a theme

Saving a theme can be read in two ways. One is to save it on the Themes page by clicking **Save Theme**, the other is to save it to your filesystem. Here are these two explained:

1. ### Saving the theme on the Themes Page

   On the Themes page, click on the **Save Theme** button:
   ![large](@client/help/assets/settings-themes-save-button.png)

   <br/>

   In the dialog that appears, enter a name for the theme, and click on Save to confirm:
   ![large](@client/help/assets/settings-themes-save-confirm.png)

   <br/>

   The theme will then be saved to your user account.

2. ### Saving an existing theme to your filesystem

   Saving a theme to your filesystem is quite easy. Right-click any theme, and select the **Save to ArcFS** option:
   ![large](@client/help/assets/settings-themes-save-to-arcfs.png)

   <br/>

   In the dialog that appears, enter a file name for your theme, and click on Save to confirm:
   ![large](@client/help/assets/settings-themes-save-theme-file-to.png)

   <br/>

   The theme will then be saved to your ArcOS filesystem.
