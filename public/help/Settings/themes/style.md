# The Accent Color

Your accent color is the color used throughout ArcOS for buttons, links, and window coloring. This color can be anything you like. Keep in mind that a lighter accent color works better on a dark visual style, and vice versa.

To change the accent color, click on the **colored dot** next to the **accent color's Hex Code** on the **Themes** page:

A system dialog will appear, allowing you to change your accent color. This dialog differs between operating system and browser. Changing the color in the dialog might in some cases change it automatically in ArcOS.

> It might be worth writing this color down somewhere or saving it in a theme if you want to use it in the future. ArcOS does not remember previous accent colors.

## The Visual Style

The **Visual Style** is the main way ArcOS looks. By default, ArcOS is set to the **Dark** visual style, but there are a couple options you can choose from.

To change the visual style, click on the **dropdown** right below **"Visual Style"** on the **Themes** page:

Here is a table of the visual styles you can apply, along with their IDs:

| Name             | ID       | Description                                   |
