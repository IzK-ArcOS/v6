# Changing Visual Aspects

ArcOS has many visual aspects you can change to your liking. Is ArcOS running slow? Changing these settings might improve performance by reducing strain on your device and/or browser.

Before you continue, first open the **Settings App**. More information about opening the settings app can be found in the [Settings](@client/help/Settings.md) article under **"Opening the settings app"**. Once opened, make sure you're on the **Visuals** page by clicking on **Visuals** in the sidebar.

Below you'll find an explanation for each of the Visual settings.

## Animations

Animations are everywhere in ArcOS. From the buttons you click to the windows opening and closing, all of them have some sort of animation. If you find these animations distracting, or they impact performance too much, you can choose to turn them off on the Visuals page:

## Transparency Effects

Transparency effects mostly apply to the windows and [Shell](@client/help/Settings/shell.md) components such as the Start Menu, Taskbar and Action Center. Transparency also adds a blur behind the aforementioned components. However, because of this blur, transparency can severely impact how fast ArcOS runs. You can turn them off by enabling **No glass** on the Visuals page. Here you can see the effect it has on the Settings App sidebar:

| With transparency                                                  | Without transparency                                            |

## Sharp Corners

Careful! These things are sharp. Rounded corners can also be turned off in ArcOS. You might find that a metro appearance fits your taste better. If that's the case, you can turn off rounded corners by enabling **Sharp corners** on the Visuals page. Here you can see the effect it has:

| Rounded Corners                                                  | Sharp Corners                                                 |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |

## Custom Cursors

ArcOS ships with a custom cursor set that replaces the cursors of your operating system. This is done to give ArcOS a more immersive experience. However, if you don't like these cursors, you can choose to turn them off by enabling **No custom cursors** on the Visuals page:

## Broad Accent Colors

Enabling this setting will apply the [Accent Color](@client/help/Settings/themes/style.md) you chose to the windows and [Shell](@client/help/Settings/shell.md) components such as the Start Menu, Taskbar and Action Center. This setting adds a subtle accent to the background of the aforementioned components. Enable **Broad Accent Colors** on the visuals page to enable this setting. Here you can see the effect it has:

| Without Broad Accent Colors                                          | With Broad Accent Colors                                            |
