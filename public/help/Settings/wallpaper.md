# The Desktop Wallpaper

The desktop wallpaper is the beautiful image you see every time you log in. It's always visible behind everything, and changes the entire look-and-feel of ArcOS. In this article you'll learn how to:

- Apply a wallpaper
- Upload a wallpaper from your device
- Use a Internet Address (URL) as a wallpaper

Before you continue, first open the **Settings App**. More information about opening the settings app can be found in the [Settings](@client/help/Settings.md) article under **"Opening the settings app"**. Once opened, make sure you're on the **Wallpaper** page by clicking on **Wallpaper** in the sidebar.

## Applying a wallpaper

There are two ways to apply a wallpaper in ArcOS. One is through the [Settings App](@client/help/Settings.md), the other using the Image Viewer. Here they are:

1. **Applying a wallpaper through the Settings App** <br/>
   To apply a wallpaper in Settings, make sure you're on the **Wallpaper** page. Then, click on one of the wallpapers displayed below the preview:

   <br/>
   This will apply the wallpaper immediately.

2. **Applying a wallpaper using Image Viewer** <br/>
   Applying a theme through the Image Viewer is quite easy. First, open any image in the Image Viewer. This can be done either:

   - by opening Image Viewer, and selecting any image from the dialog that appears, or
   - by opening the File Manager, and opening any image from there.

   Once an image is opened in the Image Viewer, you can go to the **File** menu, and select **Set as wallpaper** to apply the wallpaper:

   It might take a second to apply the wallpaper, depending on how large the image is.

## Uploading a wallpaper from your device

Uploading a wallpaper from your device is possible, but because it will be stored on the filesystem, it might slow down ArcOS depending on the size of the image and how fast your internet speed is.

To upload a wallpaper from your device, click on the **Upload button** on the **Wallpaper** page:

A system dialog will appear, allowing you to pick any image. This image will then be uploaded to `Home/Wallpapers` on your ArcOS filesystem. The wallpaper will be automatically applied.

## Using a URL as wallpaper

To use a URL as wallpaper, click on the **Wallpaper from URL** button on the Wallpaper page:
![large](@client/help/assets/settings-wallpaper-url-button.png)

In the dialog that appears, enter any valid image URL, and click on **Confirm** to save the changes:
