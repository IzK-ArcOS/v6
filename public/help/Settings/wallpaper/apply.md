# Applying a wallpaper

There are two ways to apply a wallpaper in ArcOS. One is through the [Settings App](@client/help/Settings.md), the other using the Image Viewer. Here they are:

1. ### Applying a wallpaper through the Settings App

   To apply a wallpaper in Settings, make sure you're on the **Wallpaper** page. Then, click on one of the wallpapers displayed below the preview:
   ![large](@client/help/assets/settings-wallpaper-grid.png)

   <br/>
   This will apply the wallpaper immediately.

2. ### Applying a wallpaper using Image Viewer

   Applying a theme through the Image Viewer is quite easy. First, open any image in the Image Viewer. This can be done either:

   - by opening Image Viewer, and selecting any image from the dialog that appears, or
   - by opening the File Manager, and opening any image from there.

   Once an image is opened in the Image Viewer, you can go to the **File** menu, and select **Set as wallpaper** to apply the wallpaper:
   ![large](@client/help/assets/settings-wallpaper-image-viewer-apply.png)

   It might take a second to apply the wallpaper, depending on how large the image is.
