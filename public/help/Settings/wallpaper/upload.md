# Uploading a wallpaper from your device

Uploading a wallpaper from your device is possible, but because it will be stored on the filesystem, it might slow down ArcOS depending on the size of the image and how fast your internet speed is.

To upload a wallpaper from your device, click on the **Upload button** on the **Wallpaper** page:

A system dialog will appear, allowing you to pick any image. This image will then be uploaded to `Home/Wallpapers` on your ArcOS filesystem. The wallpaper will be automatically applied.
