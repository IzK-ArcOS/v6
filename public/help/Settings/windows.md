# Changing Windows

You've already interacted with an ArcOS Window without even realising it. In fact, you're reading this article right now, being displayed in a Window. The appearance of said window can too be changed to your liking. This Settings page allows you to change the appearance of ArcOS windows.

Before you continue, first open the **Settings App**. More information about opening the settings app can be found in the [Settings](@client/help/Settings.md) article under **"Opening the settings app"**. Once opened, make sure you're on the **Windows** page by clicking on **Windows** in the sidebar.

Below you'll find an explanation for each of the Window settings.

## Large Titlebar

The titlebar is the bar you see at the top of every normal window. It can be made large or small, your choice. Enable the large titlebar by turning on the **Large Titlebar** setting on the Windows page. Here is a preview:

## Swapped Titlebar

When enabled, the Window title and controls (such as the Close button) are swapped. The window controls will then appear on the left side of the titlebar, instead of on the right. To swap the titlebar, enable the **Left titlebar buttons** setting on the Windows page. Here is another preview:

## Centered title

When enabled, the Window Title is put in the middle of the titlebar, instead of to the side. It gives the window Windows 8-like appearance. To turn on this feature, enable the **Center window title** setting on the Windows page. Here is yet another preview:
