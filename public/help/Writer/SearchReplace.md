# The Search And Replace option
It **is** pretty simple:
- You can activate it with the F3 key when in a document
- In the **Search** text box you enter the text you want Writer to search for
- In the **Replace** text box, you enter the text you want Writer to replace the text in the **Search** box with.
#### Example:
**Search** - Isaac
**Replace** - Izaak

Now, Writer will replace **all** occurences of Isaac with Izaak (in the document of course).


~~I bet Izaak gonna love me for this one~~ 

~~*..or is he?*~~
